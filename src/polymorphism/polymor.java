public class polymor {
	
	// 1. polymorphism means one class/entity behaves differently in different cases.
	// 2. means what class is working or giving different output in different places.
	/* 3. Polymorphism is achived by using two ways.
	 *    1. Method overriding   --> runtime polymor
	 *    2. Method overloading  --> compile time 
	 *    
	 *    
	 *    3. Method overloading:
	 *       3.1 Method name should be same 
	 *       3.2 number of argument should be there
	 *       3.3 data type should be different 
	 *       3.4 we can'nt achieve method overloading via changing return data type of method.
	 *     
	 *  4. Runtime error :
	 *     4.1 runtime error is occur while executing the program
	 *     
	 *  5. compile time error
	 *     5.1 compile time error occur while compilation of code/program
